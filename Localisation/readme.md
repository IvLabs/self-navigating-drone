### Objective

To estimate the position of a vehicle along a trajectory using available measurements and a motion model given.

### Motion Model

This shows how the current state of our vehicle changes based on the control inputs given.

### Observation/ Measurement model 

As we have an estimate of the position of the car using motion model, we will refine it using the observation made from the sensors.

### Extended Kalman Filter

The EKF computes the weighted average of these actual sensor measurements at the current time step t and predicted sensor measurements to generate a better current state estimate.
